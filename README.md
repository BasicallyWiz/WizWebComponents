# Wiz' Web Components
A collection of Blazor components I've made so I don't have to keep re-writing shit I've made before.

This project can also be used as a good example of component design, and programming practices, as I'm pretty confident with those.
This also shows code-behind and how to use that pretty well.

## What's with the empty wwwroot?
I write this while working on another project, and usually when I add styles and assets to the folder, they usually just don't work at all. (I believe the story might be different after solution publish)

## How To Use
### I want the code (Preferred)
If you'd like to have the ability to write code into this package, you can simply add this .csproj to any dependent packages in your project references.
### I just want the components
You can publish this project to a .dll, and include that, I haven't tried it, but It'll probably work.
